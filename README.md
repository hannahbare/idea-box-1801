#Project: Idea Box

####Specs: 
Every developer has more ideas than time. In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas.  Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, weâ€™ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.
